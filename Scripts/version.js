    Thanks for everything man! You single-handledly have
made me feel 𝘯𝘰𝘵 𝘢𝘭𝘰𝘯𝘦 in the realm of coding, and it
has literally 𝘮𝘦𝘢𝘯𝘵 𝘵𝘩𝘦 𝘸𝘰𝘳𝘭𝘥. If you 𝘦𝘷𝘦𝘳 need something,
have a question, idea, or just want to chat, feel 𝘧𝘳𝘦𝘦
to reach out! I wish you the best for your next couple
years at Valley— take care of Coach for me lol. Happy
coding, and thanks for keeping this project updated
for the school!
